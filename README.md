## *Introduction to plants breeding concepts for no-breeders*

In this repo, we will explain notions related to plants breeding for no-breeding working. 
In the context of a plant breeding program focused on research, genomic selection is a technique that utilises information from an organism's genomic data to predict its breeding value. Breeding value refers to the genetic merit of an individual for a particular trait of interest, such as **yield**, **disease resistance**, or **quality**.
Genomic selection involves collecting and analyzing genomic data from a large number of individuals within a population. This data typically includes information on specific regions of the genome, known as markers, which are associated with the trait of interest. By comparing the markers with the observed phenotypic data (**traits expressed in an organism**), statistical models can be used to estimate the breeding value of individuals that were not directly phenotypes. The advantage of genomic selection is that it allows breeders to predict the breeding value of individuals at an early stage, even before they have been phenotyped. This can greatly speed up the breeding process by enabling the selection of individuals with desirable traits at the molecular level. Additionally, genomic selection can be particularly useful for traits that are difficult or expensive to measure directly.
However, it is important to note that genomic selection requires a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between markers and traits, as well as access to accurate and high-quality genomic data. As you mentioned, your knowledge on genomic selection is limited, so further research and consultation with experts in the field may be necessary to fully understand and implement this technique in your plant breeding program.

1. QTL 
A quantitative trait locus (QTL) refers to a specific region on a plant's chromosome that is associated with a particular trait or characteristic. These traits are typically quantitative, meaning they can be measured and vary in degree, such as plant height, yield, or resistance to disease.
A QTL is like a signpost that indicates the general location of a gene or a set of genes responsible for controlling the trait of interest. By studying the DNA of plants and looking for variations in the genetic code, plant breeders can identify these QTLs and understand which regions of the genome are linked to specific traits.
Once a QTL is identified, plant breeders can use this information to develop new plant varieties with desired characteristics. They can selectively breed plants that have the desired QTLs, allowing them to enhance traits like yield, quality, or disease resistance. This knowledge helps breeders make informed decisions about which plants to cross and which traits to prioritize in their breeding programs.
In summary, a QTL in plant breeding is a specific region on a plant's chromosome associated with a quantitative trait. It serves as a marker that helps plant breeders understand the genetic basis of traits and design breeding strategies to develop plants with desired characteristics.
