## *Introduction to plants breeding concepts for no-breeders*

In this repo, we will explain notions related to plants breeding for no-breeding working. 
In the context of a plant breeding program focused on research, genomic selection is a technique that utilises information from an organism's genomic data to predict its breeding value. Breeding value refers to the genetic merit of an individual for a particular trait of interest, such as **yield**, **disease resistance**, or **quality**.
Genomic selection involves collecting and analyzing genomic data from a large number of individuals within a population. This data typically includes information on specific regions of the genome, known as markers, which are associated with the trait of interest. By comparing the markers with the observed phenotypic data (**traits expressed in an organism**), statistical models can be used to estimate the breeding value of individuals that were not directly phenotypes. The advantage of genomic selection is that it allows breeders to predict the breeding value of individuals at an early stage, even before they have been phenotyped. This can greatly speed up the breeding process by enabling the selection of individuals with desirable traits at the molecular level. Additionally, genomic selection can be particularly useful for traits that are difficult or expensive to measure directly.
However, it is important to note that genomic selection requires a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between markers and traits, as well as access to accurate and high-quality genomic data. As you mentioned, your knowledge on genomic selection is limited, so further research and consultation with experts in the field may be necessary to fully understand and implement this technique in your plant breeding program.

1. **QTL** 
A quantitative trait locus (QTL) refers to a specific region on a plant's chromosome that is associated with a particular trait or characteristic. These traits are typically quantitative, meaning they can be measured and vary in degree, such as plant height, yield, or resistance to disease.
A QTL is like a signpost that indicates the general location of a gene or a set of genes responsible for controlling the trait of interest. By studying the DNA of plants and looking for variations in the genetic code, plant breeders can identify these QTLs and understand which regions of the genome are linked to specific traits.
Once a QTL is identified, plant breeders can use this information to develop new plant varieties with desired characteristics. They can selectively breed plants with the desired QTLs, allowing them to enhance traits like yield, quality, or disease resistance. This knowledge helps breeders make informed decisions about which plants to cross and which traits to prioritize in their breeding programs.
In summary, a QTL in plant breeding is a specific region on a plant's chromosome associated with a quantitative trait. It serves as a marker that helps plant breeders understand the genetic basis of traits and design breeding strategies to develop plants with desired characteristics.

2. **VPD : Vapor Pressure Deficit**
VPD is the difference between the amount of moisture in the air (humidity) and the maximum amount of moisture the air can hold at a specific temperature. It's a measure of how dry the air is. Leaf Water: Inside the leaves of plants, there is a continuous flow of water called transpiration. This is similar to how we sweat to cool down; plants transpire to regulate their temperature and transport nutrients.
Inducing Water Loss: When the VPD is high, meaning the air is dry, it creates a condition where the air is thirsty for moisture. As a result, the air pulls moisture out of the leaves through a process called evaporation. The water from the leaves evaporates into the air to fulfil its moisture needs.
Drop of Leaf Water: As the moisture evaporates from the leaves, the plant's water content decreases. This leads to a drop in the water pressure inside the leaf cells. To maintain their structure and function, plants need a certain level of water pressure.
Consequences: When the water pressure inside the leaf cells drops, it can negatively affect the plant in several ways. The reduced water pressure can cause the leaves to wilt, become flaccid, or even die. It can also disrupt the plant's ability to transport nutrients efficiently.
In summary, when the Vapor Pressure Deficit is high, the dry air pulls moisture out of the leaves through evaporation, leading to a drop in leaf water content. This can cause various issues for the plant, including wilting and nutrient transport problems.

3. **Agricultural Drought**:
Agricultural drought in the context of plant breeding refers to a condition where there is a **lack of water available** for crops to grow and develop properly. It occurs when the amount of rainfall or irrigation water is insufficient to meet the water requirements of the plants. This shortage of water can negatively affect the growth, yield, and health of crops, making it difficult for farmers to grow and harvest their crops successfully. Plant breeders work to develop new crop varieties that are more resilient to drought conditions, meaning they can tolerate and survive with less water. By improving the drought tolerance of crops, plant breeders help farmers minimize the negative effects of drought and ensure a more stable food production.
Definition From Vincent Vadez et al 2024.
   - **Severe** (or survival) drought: when the growth processes stop because the crop can no longer extract water from the soil. If a severe drought occurs before grain filling stage, most crops fail and reach zero yield.
   - **Seedling stage drought**: when the crop is planted in a dry soil or after a first rain, and is followed by a gap in rainfall of 2–4 weeks.
   - **Moderate drought**:when growth processes continue at a reduced rate, because the crop cannot extract all the water it needs. Depending on the timing, duration and frequency of occurrence during the crop cycle, the yield reductions can be 30–70%.
   - **Terminal drought**, also called post-flowering drought: a common type of drought occurring either at the end of the rainy season or when crops depend on the soil profile moisture. In these situations, the crop faces water limitation during the last stages of its development, usually after flowering and during grain filling.
   - **Intermittent drought**: when there are rain gaps during the regular crop season, leading to periods of water limitations that can be relieved by rainfall or irrigation.
